# Tic Tac Toe

This is my very first program I completed while on the MSSA Program. Though it seems like a simple game it
did challenge me to think more from a devlopers mind set. This is the final product and I know I can build
upon it and refine it. I'd like to keep this here to remind me where I started and that we are all capable of anything!
